class_name LevelshotReferenceRect
extends ReferenceRect

# Use this special reference rect to manual mark the boundaries of your 2d level
# Then check the option to use this for the level boundary rather than calculating it
# When to use this:
#  1. If the boundary calculation takes too long
#  2. The boundary calculation is incorrect
#  3. You don't want everything in the level in the levelshot image
