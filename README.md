# Godot Levelshot For Godot 3.x
This plugin allows you to take a screenshot of your entire 2d game level.  It does this by launching a special scene in debug mode that loads the game level scene, does some in-memory modifications to it, adds a 2d camera to the center of the game level, and zooms it out until the entire level is in view and saves off the viewport texture.

This plugin can handle as many level scenes as you need, and even take levelshots in batch.

## Installation

 1. Download or clone this repository
 2. Copy the levelshot folder from the project/addons folder into your project
 3. Enable the Levelshot plugin on the Plugins tab on the Project Settings dialog


## Godot Asset Library?

This plugin will be added to the Godot asset library once it's been tested a bit by the community and maybe some more enhancements have been made.  At that time the installation instructions will be updated.

## Godot 4 Version?

This plugin will be ported to Godot 4 at some point when the plugin has been whipped into a useful form and is not likely to be changed very much.
